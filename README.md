# Gothic-unZENity-VR
This repository aims to leverage Unity as Open Source VR solution to work with Gothic 1/2, Mods, and Total Conversions.

It's a PoC if the idea of _Importing everything from Gothic and act as the new engine (ZenGine --> Unity) behind the scenes can work.

Heavily inspired and reusing code from:
* [REGoth-bs](https://github.com/REGoth-project/REGoth-bs)
* [OpenGothic](https://github.com/Try/OpenGothic)


## FAQ

**Q: What an awkward name...**  
A: True! It's a combination of Gothic, Unity, Zen, VR, and a grain of insanity.
